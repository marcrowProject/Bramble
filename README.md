# :seedling: Bramble a new hacking Open source suite.
## :scroll: Summary
 Bramble software has been designed for the bramble project. It incorporates many features
of pentesting and IT Security. It's easy to use and completely editable. It allows 
beginners to learn hacking and gives more experienced users a customisable plug and 
play hacking tools so they can add their own code quickly. 

## :clubs: Contribute
 Bramble is an open source project to which you can contribute ! If you develop some 
features, don't be shy and share it with us. We will work together in order to implement
it in the platform.


## :mag: How it works
 Bramble is based mainly on C++. But you can adding easily some code using another language. If you 
don't like C++ (that would be a mistake ^^) it doesn't really matter because i offer some templates 
to help you and to save your time. 
I try to put lots of comments in my code and i add some links to online classes/articles 
to have a better understanding of how the code works.
Finally for each features i wrote a help file to give you informations about how to use it 
step by step.
